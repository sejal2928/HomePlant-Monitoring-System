Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a Home Plant Monitoring System. The system is designed to help users monitor the health and well-being of their indoor plants by collecting data on environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity. The data collected by the system can be used to assess the needs of the plants and take appropriate actions to ensure their optimal growth.

Components
The Home Plant Monitoring System consists of the following components:

Hardware Sensors: Sensors to measure environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity.
Microcontroller: A microcontroller (e.g., Arduino or Raspberry Pi) to interface with the sensors, collect data, and transmit it to the central processing unit.
Central Processing Unit (CPU): A central processing unit (e.g., a computer or a cloud server) to receive and process the data from the microcontroller.
Database: A database to store the collected data for historical analysis and visualization.
Web Interface or Mobile App: An interface (web-based or mobile application) for users to monitor the status of their plants, view historical data, and receive alerts or notifications.
Functionality
The Home Plant Monitoring System performs the following functions:

Data Collection: Continuously collects data from the sensors regarding environmental conditions around the plants.
Data Transmission: Transmits the collected data to the central processing unit for analysis and storage.
Data Storage: Stores the collected data in a database for future reference and analysis.
Data Analysis: Analyzes the collected data to assess the health and needs of the plants.
Alerts and Notifications: Sends alerts or notifications to users based on predefined thresholds or conditions (e.g., low soil moisture, high temperature).
Visualization: Provides users with visualizations of the collected data, such as graphs and charts, to help them understand the trends and patterns.
Usage
To set up and use the Home Plant Monitoring System, follow these steps:

Hardware Setup: Connect the sensors to the microcontroller according to the provided instructions.
Software Installation: Install the necessary software on the microcontroller and central processing unit.
Database Configuration: Set up the database to store the collected data.
Interface Development: Develop the web interface or mobile app for users to interact with the system.
System Integration: Integrate all components of the system and ensure they communicate effectively.
User Interaction: Users can access the interface to monitor their plants, view historical data, and receive alerts or notifications as needed.

Heart Disease Prediction Model
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical attributes. The model is built using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Heart Disease UCI dataset, which is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains 14 attributes including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, and other medical measurements. The target variable is the presence of heart disease, which is binary (1 = presence, 0 = absence).

Model
The heart disease prediction model is built using a supervised learning approach, specifically a classification algorithm. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset with known outcomes (presence or absence of heart disease) and then evaluated on a separate portion of the dataset to assess its performance.

The following steps are involved in building the model:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Model Selection: Trying out different classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines to determine the best-performing model.
Model Training: Using the selected algorithm to train the model on the training dataset.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model on the test dataset using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Fine-Tuning: Optimizing hyperparameters of the chosen model to improve its performance further.
Usage
To use the heart disease prediction model, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Prepare your dataset: Ensure your dataset is in a compatible format similar to the Heart Disease UCI dataset, with the same attributes and target variable.
Split your dataset into training and testing sets.
Run the train.py script, passing the paths to your training and testing datasets as arguments.
Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data by calling the predict function with the relevant input features.
Evaluation
The performance of the model can be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model is able to correctly classify instances of heart disease.
